            <p><h2><strong> MY WHY</strong></h2></p>
    <p>I have chosen my why to finish this bootcamp and to  start <strong>my journey</strong> in the tech industry</p> 
    <h3>Mi Familia</h3>
    <ol>For my <strong>family</strong>; coming from a low income family this will help tremendously, not just financially and will give a peace of mind to my family so they do not have to worry about me, nor do they have to worry about things that money can buy.  They say money cannot buy happiness, but it definitely  can make life easier.  You see and hear about people in the industry creating generational wealth with their hands in tech companies, such as stock options and patenting softwares to get residual income or royalties from their inventions.  I believe it will give the next generations in my family to have someone to look up to and easily say to themselves, "Tony did it why can't I."</ol><br>
